    <p>Thank you for taking a trip down the lane of my persona.</p>

      <h2>Here is a list of my recent projects</h2>

      <p>Though they are incomplete, they show my growth as I have learned more about the coding and practiced different elements.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>This is my <a href="https://github.com/Dethik/My_First_Webpage">first project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project was meant to learn the basic framework of HTML.</li>
        <li>This is my<a href="https://github.com/Dethik/Resort-Project">next project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project may be incomplete, but it allowed me to reaffirm the basics and learn to anchor links and branch/merge.</li>
        <li>This is<a href="https://github.com/Dethik/Cupcake_Shop">another project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project was to practice with styling a page, and learn to utilize classes.</li>
        <li>This is my<a href="https://github.com/Dethik/Boring_Lecture">final project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project helped me reaffirm all that I had learned in the past week, and learn the basics of floating.</li>
