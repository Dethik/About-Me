      <h2>Here is a list of my recent projects</h2>
      <p>Though they are <em>incomplete</em>, they show my <em>growth</em> as I have learned more about the coding and practiced different elements.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>This is my <a href="https://github.com/Dethik/My_First_Webpage">first project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project was meant to learn the basic framework of HTML.</li>
        <li>This is my <a href="https://github.com/Dethik/Resort-Project">next project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project may be incomplete, but it allowed me to reaffirm the basics and learn to anchor links and branch/merge.</li>
        <li>This is <a href="https://github.com/Dethik/Cupcake_Shop">another project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project was to practice with styling a page, and learn to utilize classes.</li>
        <li>This is my <a href="https://github.com/Dethik/Boring_Lecture">final project</a>, using HTML and CSS. This project helped me reaffirm all that I had learned in the past week, and learn the basics of floating.</li>

    <h2>A Bit About <span class="important">Myself!</span></h2>
    <p id="mepara">I grew up around computers, and always enjoyed helping my father building them and maintaining them. However after graduating from high school I was a drift and didn't know what I wanted to do. I got a job doing shipping and receiving for a machine making company. After I was laid off, I got a job through a temp agency working for an HVAC company. Through this company I got the opportunity to start a career in CNC Machining with Mills and Lathes. The Head Machinist took me as his apprentice. By the end of my 4 years with that company I was the Head Machinist with a promising future, but Covid had other plans for me. Once unemployed I found it difficult to find a job in that field so I decided I would take my programming knowledge from machining and try to apply the concepts here at Epicodus. It is difficult and most certainly different, but it is good to work my brain again.</p>
    <h3 class="important">Some of my Hobbies, and Favorite Passtimes.</h3>
    <p class="gaming">Gaming is hands down my favorite activity, from FPS to Strategy and back to RPG games. I love them all and I enjoy most games I try. Hands down my favorite game of all time though would have to be <strong>Warframe.</strong> Ninjas in Space, how can you beat that?</p>
    <ul id="personal">
      <li>Gaming</li>
      <li>Spending time with my Family</li>
      <li>Building and Tearing apart PCs</li>
      <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="important">My Fursiblings</h4>
    <img src="Fursiblings.jpg" alt="Photo of two pugs and a cat hidden" width="400" height="420">
    <p class="pets">I have four Fursiblings, these including a pair of Pugs and a pair of Cats. The Pug's are the elder of the bunch, <span id="pip">Pippen</span> (the Light Pug) and <span id="lucky">Lucky</span> (the Dark Pug) are 14 and 11 respectively. The Cat's <span id="han">Hannah</span> (a White Cat) and <span id="clem">Clemintine</span> (the Black Cat in the photo) who are new to the family are 9 months old. Pippen is Lucky's father, and they've both slowed down in their old age. Don't let that fool you though, they still get up and run with the big dogs sometimes. Ironically, Hannah is a little angel being fairly well behaved most of the time. While Clemintine is a little demon getting into trouble as often as possible.</p>
